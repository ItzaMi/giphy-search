# Weather Website using OpenWeather API

As it stands, the code for this project **is not functional** since it has no API key in it. For safety reasons, as you can see by the *.gitignore* file, **config.js** was not pushed to this repository.
To see this website in action you should clone the code and create a **credentials.js** file with the following information:

>let credentials = {
>
>		API_KEY: your-api-key-here
>
>};

You can obtain your free API OpenWeather key here: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/sdk .

I'll update this README file with a video and images of the functional website!
